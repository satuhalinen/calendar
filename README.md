# VOCA - Voluntary Calendars

## Description

This is the final group project for the Full-stack Web Developer program in Business College Helsinki.
Our assignment was to create a React based 'calendars as a service' full-stack app using technologies covered in our program.

The goal of our app is to offer advent-style calendar creation as a service, but with a twist. With our platform, users can create personalized calendars that encourage acts of kindness, generosity and voluntary work throughout the holiday season and beyond.

From donating to organizations supporting various causes to volunteering in your community, our calendars inspire meaningful acts that benefit others. Each hatch in our calendars is customizable, allowing users to tailor the content to specific categories: animals, children&teenagers, adults and the elderly and select between different ways of helping, like through donations or hands-on assistance.
